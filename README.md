### Cross-Platform Development with Cordova and Visual Studio

The presentation can be seen live [here](http://jpoon.github.io/Cordova-Reveal/) and was prepared for  [Droidcon Dubai 2015](http://www.droidcon.ae/). 

To emphasis the point that any JavaScript framework could be used within a Cordova application, the [HTML-based presentation](https://github.com/jpoon/Cordova-Reveal) was re-packaged as a Cordova application.
